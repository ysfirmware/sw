Changed the sign imput into the Control logic. Allow the user to define a constant response velocity in the support file (>0) 
or use the PID controller for the response (<0)

Changed logic to allow the user to start the test from different positions not only from two inches. Added  a value of 500 to signify
that the load test was taking place.
  
Added a condion for the global variable RxTx  in the change DUT VI. Changes to (true) before the channel change and then back to (false) after the channel
is changed. Allows the transceiver to change channel.

Changed steps of the loading condition. Moved the program DUT routine to execute after the load accuracy test routine.

No stoping between the loading test and load accuracy test

Height that mark10 moves between load test and load accuracy is reduced to 10% of the 2 inches that it moved previously

Start Channel Initialized to 5. Ensures that transeiver channel will return to the start channel at the end of each test.

Can read and create xlsm files

Updates pages that are being programmed

Gives option to retry device programing

Target Channel and Operating Channel are initialized via config files

Target Channel is no longer enabled to the user

Displays what the operator chose during programming retry

Updates tranceiver channel indicator through globals
